**Project Description:**
This project is an exploratory analysis of a restaurant tip dataset. The goal is to identify **customer behavior patterns** and **key business metrics** that can help optimize restaurant operations.

The analysis focuses on answering questions such as:
* Is there a relationship between party size and tips?
* What day of the week is most popular for customers?

* **Weekends** (especially Saturdays) are the busiest days.

The dataset used (`tips`) is public and is part of the `seaborn` Python library, a reliable and stable source for educational and practice purposes.

**Technologies Used:**
* **Python:** Programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
* **Git and GitHub:** For version control and project deployment.
