E-commerce Sales Analysis
Author: Juan GÃ³mez

Project Description:
This project is an exploratory analysis of sales data from an e-commerce store. The main objective is to uncover hidden patterns, sales trends, and key business metrics that can inform strategic decision-making.

Through this analysis, we seek to answer questions such as:

Which products sell the most?

Which days of the week generate the most revenue?

Is there a relationship between the number of products purchased and the total transaction value?

Dataset:
The data used for this analysis is public and obtained from a reliable source.

Technologies Used:

Python: For data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: Primary library for data analysis.

Git & GitHub: For version control and project deployment.

Data Visualization: Tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn will be used to visualize the results.

Project Status:
[In progress]
